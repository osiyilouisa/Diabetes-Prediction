# **Diabetes-Prediction**
Predicting Type 2 Diabetes using Ensemble Techniques (KNN, SVM, LGBM and Logistic Regression)


## **Project Description**  
This project predicts the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes using a **stacking ensemble model** that combines **SVM, KNN, LGBM, and Logistic Regression**. The goal is to improve predictive accuracy by leveraging multiple machine learning techniques.  

## **Dataset**  
- The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).  
- Preprocessing steps included:  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Feature selection  
  - Data scaling  
  - Train-test splitting  

## **Model Training & Evaluation**  
- The model was trained using a **stacking ensemble approach** with **SVM, KNN, LGBM, and Logistic Regression**.  
- Evaluation metrics:  
  - Accuracy: 98.05%  
  - F1-score: 96.3%  
  - Precision: 98%
  - Recall: 99%
  - Precision for Class 0: 98% 
  - Recall for Class 0: 99% 
  - Precision for Class 1: 98% 
  - Recall for Class 1: 95%
